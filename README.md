# Binary to Decimal Converter

This is a simple Visual Basic console application that converts a binary number (represented as a string) into its decimal equivalent.

## How It Works

The program contains a function `ConvertBintoDec` which:

- Takes a binary number as a string input (`"10110"`).
- Processes each bit and calculates the decimal value.
- Returns the decimal number as a string.

The `Main` subroutine tests this function by converting a sample binary number and printing the result.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. The program will convert the hardcoded binary string (currently `"10110"`) to decimal.
3. The output will display the binary input and its decimal equivalent.
